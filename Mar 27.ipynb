    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the independent variables have no explanatory power, and 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data."
