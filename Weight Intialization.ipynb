    "Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Give it a name that is relevant to your assignment.\n",
    "Clone the repository: On your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store your assignment files. Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository onto your local machine.\n",
    "Add your assignment files: Copy your Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and any other necessary files into the cloned repository directory.\n",
    "Commit and push your changes: Use the git add command to stage your changes, followed by the git commit command to commit the changes. Finally, use the git push command to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "Verify the repository: Go to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you created. Ensure that all your assignment files are present and accessible.\n",
    "Finally, to rename your Jupyter Notebook file using the format \"date_month_topic.ipynb\", you can simply rename the file in your local repository directory and then commit and push the changes to GitHub."
