    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    " Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to perform regression tasks. It is a variant of the Random Forest algorithm, which uses a combination of bagging and feature randomness to create an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees.\n",

    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    " Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two main mechanisms: bagging and feature randomness. Bagging involves training each decision tree in the ensemble on a different subset of the training data, which helps to reduce the impact of individual noisy or outlier data points. Feature randomness involves randomly selecting a subset of features for each tree, which helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and increase the diversity of the ensemble. By combining the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest Regressor can generalize well and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    " Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging the individual predictions. Each decision tree in the ensemble independently makes a prediction based on the input features. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by taking the average of these individual predictions. This aggregation process helps to reduce the variance and improve the overall accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    " Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance. Some of the commonly used hyperparameters include the number of trees in the ensemble (n_estimators), the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth), the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split), and the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split (max_features). Other hyperparameters include the criterion for splitting (e.g., mean squared error or mean absolute error) and the random seed for reproducibility\n",

    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    " The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor lies in their approach to modeling. While Random Forest Regressor combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree. Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees and introducing randomness in the training process. In contrast, Decision Tree Regressor is prone to overfitting as it can capture the noise and intricacies of the training data. Random Forest Regressor generally provides better generalization and robustness compared to Decision Tree Regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of Random Forest Regressor include its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality, its resistance to overfitting, and its capability to capture complex nonlinear relationships. Random Forest Regressor is also less sensitive to outliers and missing data. However, it may suffer from increased computational complexity and longer training times compared to simpler models. Additionally, the interpretability of Random Forest Regressor may be lower than that of a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value. It predicts the target variable based on the input features and the learned relationships from the training data. The predicted value represents the estimated numerical value of the target variable for a given set of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    " Yes, Random Forest Regressor can also be used for classification tasks. In classification, Random Forest Classifier is typically used, which is a variant of Random Forest Regressor. Instead of predicting continuous numerical values, Random Forest Classifier predicts discrete class labels. It combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to determine the class label with the majority vote or the highest probability."
