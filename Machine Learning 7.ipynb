    "Ans.Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable in a supervised machine learning setting. It assigns ordinal labels to categories based on the mean (or any other aggregate function) of the target variable for each category. The encoding captures the target-related information, making it useful in certain scenarios.\n",
