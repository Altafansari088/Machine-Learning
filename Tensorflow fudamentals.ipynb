    "The different data structures used in TensorFlow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors: Tensors are the primary data structure in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays that can hold numerical data. Examples include scalars, vectors, and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: Constants are tensors whose values cannot be changed once assigned. They are typically used to store fixed values in a TensorFlow graph.\n",
    "Variables: Variables are tensors whose values can be changed during the execution of a TensorFlow graph. They are commonly used to store and update the parameters of a model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placeholders: Placeholders are tensors that act as input nodes in a TensorFlow graph. They are used to feed data into the graph during the execution.\n",
    "The TensorFlow constant differs from a TensorFlow variable in the following ways:\n",
    "Constants have fixed values that cannot be changed, while variables can be updated during the execution of a TensorFlow graph.\n",
    "Constants are typically used to store fixed values, such as hyperparameters or input data, while variables are used to store and update the parameters of a model.\n",
    "Constants are initialized with a specific value and retain that value throughout the execution, while variables are initialized with an initial value but can be modified using operations like assignment.\n",

    "Matrix Multiplication: Use the tf.matmul() function or the @ operator to perform matrix multiplication between two matrices.\n",

    "\n",
