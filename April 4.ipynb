    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification tasks. It works by creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. The algorithm starts with a root node that represents the entire dataset. It then splits the data based on different features, creating branches and sub-nodes. The splitting process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples in a node.\n",
    "To make predictions, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node. At each node, it evaluates a specific feature and follows the corresponding branch based on the feature's value. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which represents a predicted class label. The decision tree classifier assigns the majority class of the training samples in that leaf node as the predicted class for new instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves finding the best feature to split the data at each node. This is done by evaluating different splitting criteria, such as Gini impurity or information gain. The steps involved are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem by assigning one of two class labels to each instance. The algorithm splits the data based on different features, creating branches that correspond to the possible values of those features. At each node, the algorithm evaluates a feature and follows the corresponding branch based on the feature's value. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which represents a predicted class label.\n",

    "For example, in a binary classification problem of predicting whether an email is spam or not, the decision tree may split the data based on features like the presence of certain keywords or the length of the email. The algorithm learns the patterns in the training data and creates a tree-like model that can classify new emails as spam or not spam based on the learned rules."

    "Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification is based on partitioning the feature space into regions that correspond to different class labels. Each node in the decision tree represents a region in the feature space, and the splitting process divides the space into smaller regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundaries in a decision tree are axis-parallel, meaning they are aligned with the feature axes. This is because the splitting criteria used in the algorithm evaluate each feature independently. As a result, the decision tree classifier creates rectangular or hyper-rectangular regions in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, the decision tree classifier assigns the majority class of the training samples in each leaf node as the predicted class for new instances. This means that any instance falling within a particular region will be assigned the class label associated with that region."

    "Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for a classification problem is crucial as it determines how the model's performance is assessed. Different evaluation metrics focus on different aspects of the classification task, and the choice depends on the specific problem and the desired outcome.\n",
    "For example, if the goal is to minimize false positives (e.g., in medical diagnosis), precision is a suitable metric. On the other hand, if the goal is to minimize false negatives (e.g., in detecting fraudulent transactions), recall is more important. The F1 score provides a balanced measure between precision and recall and is useful when both false positives and false negatives need to be minimized."
