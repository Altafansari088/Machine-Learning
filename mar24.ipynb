    "Ans,.When handling missing data in the wine quality dataset, there are several imputation techniques you can consider. Some common techniques include mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, and using machine learning algorithms for imputation.\n",
    "Advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques can be discussed based on factors such as the nature of the missing data, the impact on the distribution of the data, and the potential bias introduced by the imputation method. For example, mean imputation is simple and preserves the mean of the variable but can introduce bias if the missing data is not missing at random\n"
