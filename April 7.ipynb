    "Q1. What is the relationship between polynomial functions and kernel functions in machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning algorithms, kernel functions are used to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. Polynomial functions are a type of kernel function that can be used to achieve this transformation. The polynomial kernel function computes the dot product between two vectors in the transformed feature space, which allows the algorithm to learn non-linear decision boundaries."

    "Q3. How does increasing the value of epsilon affect the number of support vectors in SVR?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Support Vector Regression (SVR), epsilon is a hyperparameter that controls the width of the margin around the regression line. Increasing the value of epsilon allows more data points to be within the margin, resulting in a larger number of support vectors. Conversely, decreasing the value of epsilon makes the margin narrower, leading to fewer support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How does the choice of kernel function, C parameter, epsilon parameter, and gamma parameter affect the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR)? Can you explain how each parameter works and provide examples of when you might want to increase or decrease its value?\n",
    "Kernel function: The choice of kernel function determines the type of non-linear transformation applied to the data. Different kernel functions have different properties and are suitable for different types of data. For example, the linear kernel is suitable for linearly separable data, while the radial basis function (RBF) kernel is more flexible and can handle non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "C parameter: The C parameter controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low margin violation. A smaller value of C allows more margin violations, leading to a wider margin but potentially more misclassifications. A larger value of C penalizes margin violations more heavily, resulting in a narrower margin but potentially better classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon parameter: In SVR, the epsilon parameter determines the width of the margin around the regression line. A larger value of epsilon allows more data points to be within the margin, resulting in a wider margin but potentially more regression errors. A smaller value of epsilon makes the margin narrower, potentially reducing regression errors but increasing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma parameter: The gamma parameter controls the influence of each training example on the decision boundary. A smaller value of gamma means that each training example has a broader influence, resulting in a smoother decision boundary. A larger value of gamma gives more weight to the training examples closer to the decision boundary, resulting in a more complex and potentially overfitting decision boundary.\n",

    "Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn.\n",

    "Preprocess the data using techniques like scaling or normalization to ensure that all features have similar scales.\n",

    "Create an instance of the SVC classifier and train it on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the trained classifier to predict the labels of the testing data.\n",

    "Evaluate the performance of the classifier using a metric of your choice, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tune the hyperparameters of the SVC classifier using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve its performance. These techniques allow you to search over a range of hyperparameter values and find the best combination."
