It occurs when a model becomes excessively complex, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the training data as genuine patterns. As a result, the overfitted model may perform poorly on new, unseen data because it fails to generalize well.\n\nUnderfitting:\n\nUnderfitting occurs when a model is too simple or lacks the capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the training data.

More data allows the model to generalize better and reduces the chance of memorizing noise or random fluctuations.\n\nFeature selection: Selecting relevant features and removing irrelevant or noisy ones can improve the model's performance by reducing complexity and noise. Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, or domain knowledge can help identify the most informative features.",

Here are some common methods for detecting these issues:\n\nTrain/Validation/Test Split: Splitting the dataset into three separate sets—training, validation, and testing—can help identify overfitting and underfitting. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation or test set, it indicates overfitting. Conversely, if the model performs poorly on all three sets, it suggests underfitting.\n\nLearning Curves: Learning curves provide insights into the model's performance as the training dataset size increases. By plotting the model's training and validation accuracy or error over iterations or epochs, you can observe trends. An overfitted model will have a significant gap between the training and validation curves, while an underfitted model will show low performance on both curves.",
