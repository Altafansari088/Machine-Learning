      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "source": "Embedded feature selection methods refer to techniques where the feature selection process is integrated into the model training process. Here are some common techniques used in embedded feature selection:\n\nL1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization is a technique used in linear models, such as linear regression or logistic regression. It adds a penalty term based on the absolute values of the feature coefficients during model training. L1 regularization encourages sparsity in feature selection, automatically shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. Consequently, only the most relevant features are selected.\n\nRidge Regression: Ridge regression is another regularization technique that uses L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term based on the squared magnitudes of the feature coefficients during model training. Ridge regression can help reduce the impact of irrelevant features, but it typically does not result in exact feature selection. Instead, it shrinks the coefficients of less important features towards zero, but they remain non-zero.",

      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "source": "While the Filter method for feature selection has its advantages, it also has some drawbacks. Here are some of the main drawbacks associated with the Filter method:\n\nIgnoring Feature Interactions: The Filter method evaluates features individually based on their statistical characteristics, such as correlation or information gain. It does not consider potential interactions between features, which can be crucial for some machine learning algorithms. As a result, important features that may not have strong individual correlations with the target variable could be overlooked.\n\nLack of Model-Specific Information: The Filter method does not take into account the learning algorithm that will be used for modeling. Different algorithms may have different preferences for feature subsets. A feature that may not seem relevant in isolation might become essential when combined with other features in the model. The Filter method's lack of model-specific information may result in suboptimal feature selection for a particular learning algorithm",

If you have a high-dimensional dataset with a large number of features, the Filter method can be more efficient in terms of processing time. It allows you to quickly assess the relevance of features without the need for extensive model training.\n\nInitial Feature Exploration: The Filter method is often used as an initial step in feature selection or feature exploration. It provides a quick way to gain insights into the relationship between individual features and the target variable. By identifying potentially relevant features early on, you can focus your efforts on further analysis or modeling.",
