    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a regression technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the coefficient values, effectively shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, by introducing this regularization term. OLS regression does not have a penalty term and estimates the coefficients without any constraint on their values. In contrast, Lasso Regression performs both feature selection and parameter estimation simultaneously by automatically selecting the most relevant features and discarding the irrelevant ones."

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select the most relevant features. By adding a penalty term to the cost function, Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient values, effectively shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This helps in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its interpretability. By discarding irrelevant features, Lasso Regression can also help in reducing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance."

    "\n",
    "If a coefficient is non-zero, it indicates that the corresponding feature has a non-zero effect on the target variable.\n",
    "If a coefficient is zero, it indicates that the corresponding feature has no effect on the target variable and can be considered as irrelevant."

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter is lambda (λ) or alpha (α), which controls the strength of the regularization. By adjusting this parameter, we can control the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. A higher value of lambda will result in more coefficients being shrunk to zero, leading to a sparser model with fewer features. On the other hand, a lower value of lambda will allow more coefficients to remain non-zero, resulting in a model with more features. The choice of the optimal value of lambda depends on the specific problem and can be determined using techniques such as cross-validation."

    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems. One way to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression is by applying non-linear transformations to the input features before fitting the model. For example, we can use polynomial features or other non-linear transformations to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. After applying the transformations, Lasso Regression can be used to select the most relevant features and estimate the coefficients."

    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization used. Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients to the cost function. This leads to a shrinkage of the coefficient values, but they are not set exactly to zero. On the other hand, Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This leads to a sparsity-inducing effect, where some coefficients are shrunk to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection."

    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features. Multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more features are highly correlated with each other. In Lasso Regression, the regularization term encourages sparsity in the coefficient values, which means that it can automatically select one of the highly correlated features and set the coefficients of the others to zero. This helps in dealing with multicollinearity by effectively choosing one representative feature from the correlated set."

    "\n",
    "The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression can be chosen using techniques such as cross-validation. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating the model's performance. By trying different values of lambda and selecting the one that gives the best performance on the validation set, we can determine the optimal value of lambda. Additionally, techniques such as grid search or randomized search can be used to systematically explore a range of lambda values and find the optimal one."
