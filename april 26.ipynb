    "One commonly used library for clustering in Python is scikit-learn. It provides a wide range of clustering algorithms, including K-means, DBSCAN, and AgglomerativeClustering for hierarchical clustering. Scikit-learn also offers convenient functions for preprocessing data and evaluating clustering results.\n",

    "Prepare your data: Ensure that your data is in the appropriate format for clustering. You may need to preprocess or normalize the data before applying the clustering algorithm.\n",
    "Choose a clustering algorithm: Select the appropriate algorithm based on your data and problem requirements. For example, if you have a rough estimate of the number of clusters, you can use K-means. If you want to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, DBSCAN might be a better choice.\n",
